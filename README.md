# Web_Socket

This is a chat application using python socketio and Flask. User are required to signup and then 
login to be able to get into the chat window.

I am storing cookie to dispaly name of the user and all the chat history are getting stored into a database. So when a new user logins
they will be able to see the old message. 

For installation please read install.txt file.
